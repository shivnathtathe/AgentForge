# AgentForge: Self-Evolving AI Agents

**AgentForge** is a research-driven framework for autonomous AI agents that can **create, name, register, and execute tools** at runtime using LLMs.

> Based on the paper: [Autonomous Tool-Creation in AI Agents â€“ Zenodo, 2025](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15272894)

## What It Solves
Traditional AI agents fail when a required tool is missing.

**AgentForge enables LLM-powered agents to:**
- Understand the user's task
- Autonomously write a Python function (`run()`)
- Save it as a callable tool
- Register it to a persistent tool registry
- Reuse it in future tasks

No human needed in the loop.

---

## Why It Matters
In mission-critical environments like:
- ðŸ›° Aerospace systems
- Emergency diagnostics
- Defense robotics

...agents must solve **unknown tasks in real time**.  
AgentForge gives them the ability to *evolve their own capabilities* on the fly.

## âš™Tech Stack
- **LangChain** + **gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17 (Google Generative AI)**
- On-the-fly code generation, validation, and registration
- Pythonic execution environment with parameterized tools
- `.env` awareness for API key injection
